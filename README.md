# Coding Potpourri

This repository contains a bunch of coding snippeds that seem interesting to me or help in understanding programming concepts.

For example:
* a quick overview of the basic [Haskell syntax](basics/0_syntax.hs)
* a look at the [javascript's await and the do notation](do-notation/)
* an example of [Extententials Types](existential-types/) in [Typescript](existential-types/validations.ts) and [Haskell](existential-types/validations.hs)
* [Parser combinators](parser/parser.hs) in Haskell
* a look at javascript's [async with try/catch](promise/catch.js)
